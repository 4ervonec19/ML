## Recommendation Systems Techniques Application

### This repository is focused on Recommendation Systems approaches learning & tuning during the VK Education HomeTask Challenge. Here are some popular techniques described that were used to recommend books with I2I (***Item-to-Item***) or U2I (***User-to-Item***)  recommendations types.

### Here I tried few recommendation systems techniques like:
* Region & Age recommendations
* Books co-occurences
* Users clustering analyis
* Colloborative filtering (I2I, U2I)

### All necessary info you may find [right here](recommendation_systems_submit.ipynb)
