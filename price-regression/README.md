## Prices prediction Challenge

During this competition I faced the challenge of **real estate price prediction**. <br> <br>
Couple of features were suggested for research, including **numerical**:

* ***Area***
* ***Subway closeness***
* ***Number of rooms***
* ***Number of balconies***
* ***etc.***

And **cathegorical**:
* ***Street ID***
* ***Build_tech style***
* ***Date of construction***
* ***ets.***

Bunch of heuristics and data analysis techniques were applied and final score (***MAE***) was achieved. <br><br>
Different models were launched including **Random Forest Regressor**, **Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost)**. <br><br>
Also simple **tensorflow.keras perceptron** was tested.
